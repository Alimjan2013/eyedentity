# Junction 2024: EyeDentity

We aim to make Finland the world leader of digital democracy and ensuring human participation on the Polis platform while maintaining anonymity. To address the issues, we created a human identifying tool based on deep gazing detection. It can be easily integrated with online vote platforms and provides light-weight verification and progress tracking solution.
